    "**Definition 1:** Let D be a database of points, the Eps-neighborhood of a point p, denoted by $N_{Eps}(P)$, is defined $N_{Eps}(P) = \\{q \\in D | dist(p, q) â‰¤ Eps\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Directly density-reachable\n",
    "**Definition 2:** A point p is directly density-reachable from a point q wrt. Eps, MinPts if\n",
    "1) $p \\in N_{Eps}(q)$ <br>\n",
    "2) $|N_{Eps}(q)| > MinPts$ (core point condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Density-reachable\n",
    "**Definition 3:** A point p is density-reachable from a point q wrt. Eps and MinPts if there is a chain of points $P_1, \\dots, P_n, P_1 = q, P_n = p$ such that $P_{i+1}$ is directly density-reachable from $P_i$.\n",

    "### 2.4. Density-connected\n",

    "\n",

    "1) **Maximality**: $\\forall p, q$: if $p \\in C$ and $q$ is density-reachable from $p$ wrt. Eps and MinPts, then $q \\in C$ <br>\n",
    "2) **Connectivity**: $\\forall p, q \\in C$: $p$ is density-connected to $q$ wrt. Eps and MinPts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6. Noise\n",
    "**Definition 6:** Let $C_1 ..... C_k$ be the clusters of the database D wrt. parameters $Eps_i$ and $MinPts_i$, $i = 1, \\dots, k$. Then we define the noise as the set of points in the database D not belonging to any cluster $C_i$, i.e. noise = {$p \\in D | \\forall i: p \\notin C_i$}."
